# nothing
[C#] Windows application (as in no console will open up when launched) that does nothing. Uses minimal .Net 2.0 so ever semi-modern OS can handle it. Good if you want to replace one pesky file such as 'software_reporter_tool.exe' that Chrome has recently being install, this way the file runs, exit-code is 0 (success) and nothing will be done.
